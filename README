The ET or Event Transfer system is used to transfer events (data)
between different user processes using shared memory. It's designed
for speed and reliability.
 
It was written by Carl Timmer of the Data Acquisition group of Thomas
Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.

This software runs on Solaris (2.6+) and Linux (Redhat 6.X).


The difference between this and the last version (12.0) is that in the
C library, the functions that get/put/dump/new events along with those that
have to do with stations or attachments have now been protected
against a concurrent et_close() and the unmapping of shared memory.
Also, some debugging printout was removed.

In both the C and Java libraries, an additional function now exists for a
client to kill the ET system it has opened.

Better installation for java jars into $CODA/common/jar

Allow ET to be used with libet_jni.so lib when talking to local, C-based
ET system without exiting by using sockets to talk to ET. In other words,
make java ET system completely independent of C code if necessary.

Fix bug in java jni code when ET system contains "temp" events.
