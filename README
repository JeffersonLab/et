The ET or Event Transfer system is used to transfer events (data)
between different user processes using shared memory. It's designed
for speed and reliability.
 
It was written by Carl Timmer of the Data Acquisition group of Thomas
Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.

This software runs on Solaris (2.6+) and Linux (Redhat 6.X).


The difference between this and the last version (12.0) is that
the functions that get/put/dump/new events along with those that
have to do with stations or attachments have now been protected
against a concurrent et_close() and the unmapping of shared memory.
They've also been protected against a concurrent et_station_detach.
Also, some debugging printout was removed.
